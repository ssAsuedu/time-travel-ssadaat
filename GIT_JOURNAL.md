I learned how to perform various key version control git operations, including pulling/pushing, merging, resolving conflicts etc. Two mistakes I fixed are accidentally committing something on main instead of a separate branch, and failing to switch branch because I mistakenly used -b operator while switching branch. I fixed these mistakes using cherrypick command. This cherry pick command was a features that saved the day by allowing me to move the HEAD of the main branch to the previous commit, and move that other commit to the relevant branch.
