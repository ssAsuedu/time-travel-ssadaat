I am learning how to utilize Version Control systems and writing a Zine about time travel.

## Gitignore Contents:

 I added node_modules and log files to the gitignore to ensure unnecessary files aren't included.
## Branches
 author/idea-sprint: home of author's drafts regarding topic 
editor/review: allows editor to make edits to the author's working draft
The content and intro files contain new information regarding the zine content.
